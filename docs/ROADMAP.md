# 🗺️ TREMOR Roadmap

> Open-source, community-driven prediction market monitoring

## 📍 Current Status: v0.1-alpha

### What We've Built

✅ Real-time Polymarket monitoring  
✅ Intensity scoring algorithm (v2)  
✅ Multi-timeframe analysis  
✅ Reactive UI with live updates  
✅ Smart sync prioritization  
✅ Basic AI market analysis  
✅ Data retention management

### Known Limitations

- Single data source (Polymarket only)
- No user accounts or personalization
- Limited historical analysis
- No mobile app
- Basic alerting capabilities

## 🚀 Planned Improvements

### 🎲 Kalshi Integration

Add support for Kalshi markets alongside Polymarket:

Improve real-time capabilities:

- Reduced latency to <100ms
- Historical data backfill
- Failover data sources

### 🏆 Scoring Refinements

Continue improving the algorithm:

- Better volume weighting
- Improved time window calculations
- More accurate baseline normalization
- Reduced false positives

### 🔔 Notifications

Alert users about significant movements:

- Browser notifications
- Email alerts
- Telegram bot
- Discord integration
- Webhook API for developers

### 📱 Mobile Experience
